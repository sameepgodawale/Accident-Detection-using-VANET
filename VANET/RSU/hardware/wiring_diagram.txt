 RSU Node Wiring â€” ESP32 Dev Board
==================================================

--- LoRa SX1278 Module (433 MHz) ---
LoRa VCC   -> 3.3V
LoRa GND   -> GND
LoRa SCK   -> ESP32 GPIO18
LoRa MISO  -> ESP32 GPIO19
LoRa MOSI  -> ESP32 GPIO23
LoRa NSS   -> ESP32 GPIO5
LoRa RST   -> ESP32 GPIO14
LoRa DIO0  -> ESP32 GPIO26

--- microSD Card Module (SPI) ---
SD VCC     -> 3.3V (or 5V if module supports level shifting)
SD GND     -> GND
SD CS      -> ESP32 GPIO15
SD SCK     -> ESP32 GPIO18  (shared with LoRa)
SD MISO    -> ESP32 GPIO19  (shared with LoRa)
SD MOSI    -> ESP32 GPIO23  (shared with LoRa)

--- SIM800L GSM Module ---
SIM VCC    -> 4.0V regulated (2A capable)
SIM GND    -> GND
SIM TX     -> ESP32 GPIO16 (RX2)
SIM RX     -> ESP32 GPIO17 (TX2)
SIM PWRKEY -> ESP32 GPIO4
Antenna    -> External GSM antenna

--- ESP32 Power ---
USB 5V     -> ESP32 5V pin
GND        -> Common ground (shared with all modules)

==================================================
 Notes:
 - Ensure SIM800L has dedicated 4.0V regulator and large capacitors.
 - Keep LoRa and GSM antennas physically separated (~10 cm).
 - Format SD as FAT32 before use.
