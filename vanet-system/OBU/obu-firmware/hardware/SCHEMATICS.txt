# Schematics (Text) - OBU Reference Interconnect

Power:
- Vehicle 12V -> Automotive Buck Converter -> 5V rail
- 5V rail -> LDO -> 3.3V rail for MCU, sensors, LoRa
- Optional Supercap across 5V rail for brownout protection

MCU (STM32F405RG):
- I2C1 (SCL,SDA) -> IMU (ICM-20948) and FRAM (MB85RC256)
- SPI1 (SCK,MOSI,MISO,CS) -> LoRa SX1276 (SPI)
- UART1 -> GPS module (NEO-M8N)
- SPI2 / MCP2515 -> CAN transceiver (TJA1050) (listen-only)
- GPIO -> Buttons (SOS, TEST), LED, Buzzer (with MOSFET driver)
- SPI or SDIO -> microSD slot (optional)
- SWD -> Debug (SWCLK, SWDIO)

Antennas:
- GPS antenna (active) via SMA connector from GPS module
- LoRa antenna via SMA connector from LoRa module

Notes:
- Place ferrite beads and TVS diodes on power input.
- Keep GPS antenna away from metal/obstructions; route antenna cable to roof or dash.

(For PCB design, map these nets to footprints and keep analog sensor traces short; use ground pours and thermal reliefs.)
